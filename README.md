# Steam-Game-Sale-Predictor-

This was done as Senior Design Project at my School, this is the final result, this project does not contain the scrapper used to create the database. The scrapper will not work because steamsales.rehuka.com is no longer up and this website was used to collect past game sales. 

In order to run the project you will need Tomcat Apache in order to host the JSP, this was done through the Eclipse IDE in the past.
